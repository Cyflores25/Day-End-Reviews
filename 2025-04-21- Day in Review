Layer 3: Network: IPv4, IPv6, *Routing*, "Router", Packet
Layer 2: Data Link: MAC, Ethernet, NIC, Switch, "Frame"
Static: Physically there (Road Trip) 
Dynamic: Rules
"Path" "Best Route" - METRICS: Hop, Speed, Latency/Delay
Routers (Route) are digital direction signs 
VIP: Virtual IP
HD (Hard-Drive): Magnetic, SSD, Hybrid
Interface: PATA, SCII, SATA, NVME/M.2, USB
Cables: RJ-45 T/P (twisted pair), ST, SC (one click), LC (two clicks)
Routers always have 2 network cards
"Routing Packet" - routers talking to each other
Every router has to have a default gateway 
ICMP = Ping 
Static- manually configuring a router (roadtrip) / use in small networks 
Dynamic- using algorithms to automatically determine the best path for data (learn on your own) 
BGP- internet & routing 
Transport : TCP reliable / UDP unreliable 
Header and Trailer are removed when passing through router and a new header & trailer is attached as it goes out of the..
... router and going into the server
