Today I was absolutely Honored and Blessed to be part of City of Refuge, Inc. Cyber Academy. 
Cyber Cohorts and I had the privilege to visit a prominent, growing and aspiring company, Cox Enterprises Cox Communications. 
It was fascinating to see the innovative developments throughout their organization. Heartfelt Thanks to Hadji Hicks and Gabe, your embrace, time and resources were greatly esteemed! 

Big Shout out to Primous Howard, PSM, PMP, Isabelle Barnett, J.W. Young and NPursuit Career Partners for making all of this happen. Genuinely Grateful!!
