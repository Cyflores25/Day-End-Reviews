AI DAY IN THE A !!
We got a chance to help host the AI In the A event at City of Refuge. 
We had 3 different workshops, everyone got a chance to sign up to volunteer for one of them. 
I had the chance to volunteer for the "Unlocking Chat GPT" workshop. 
Some amazing community leaders came out to take part of the workshops. It was really nice to be able to network with many of them. 
The workshops were a complete success. Teaching everyone so many of the new developments with ChatGPT and othe related AI programs.
