Day in Review notes:
-DHCP Server- Auto Assigns IP Addrs (IPv4 / IPv6) 
-DNS Server Translates IP addrs into web name (EX: 192.01.019. = Amazon.com) / Default gateway 
-Ping = test connectivity from computer to computer 
-traceroute = "what router is not working" = how many hops
-ARP (not the insurance :)) = Address Resolution Protocol = 
--- ARP Cont..= Data Link Layer = translates IP addrs into MAC addrs //= Your computer wants to send data to 192.168.1.20 â†’ ARP finds out it's at MAC address 00:1B:44:11:3A:B7.
TCP Dump= (Deal with packets) turns your computer into a collector of packets ((can also collect "frames" , packets, TCP, UDP)) / Capture
Wireshark = GUI of TCPdump
