DATA LINK LAYER: 
Switch = Intelligent, Smart // learns MAC address // can listen and talk at the same time
Media = T/P, Coax, Fiber 
CSMA/CD = Ethernet = Choas, fast (is a rule to communicate) 
-Diff. standars of Ethernet; T/P, Coax, FIber
-Ethernet technology operates at both physical and data link layer 
-Ethernet in Physical Layer: wiring/ cableing 
-Ethernet in Data Link Layer: MAC address
Baseband (TDM) (one signal) -- "block like" signal 
Broadband (FDM) (multiple signals) -- "wavy like" signal
Half Duplex: talk one at a time (Bus - Hub) 
Full Duplex: can talk at the same time (Switch) 
Access Point is a Switch using an anor hardware device (or sometimes software) that allows wireless devices (like laptops, phones, tablets)... 
 -...to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless standards.
