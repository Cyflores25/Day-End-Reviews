IP addresses are not permenant (4 parts: ex. 8bits.8bits.8bits.8bits)
MAC addresses are permanent 
Subnet Mask: way to seperate network number from the host number
Class A IP address : ex. A. 1.x.x.x - 126.x.x.x  subnet mask by default = 255.0.0.0
Net number 1.0.0.0 > X.0.0.1 Host number
Subnet Mask Classes:
-Class A: 255.0.0.0
-Class B: 255.255.0.0
-Class C: 255.255.255.0
-Class D: unknown
-Class E: unknown 
----------
A: 1.x.x.x - 126.x.x.x  // 255.0.0.0 /8
B: 128.x.x.x - 191.x.x.x // 255.255.0.0 /16
C: 192.x.x.x - 223.x.x.x  // 255.255.255.0 /24

DHCP: spits out pivate IP addresses // DHCP Process: (1) Discover (2) Offer (3) Request (4) Acknowledgement (DORA)
NAT: translates private IP addresses to public 
Private IP Addresses uses router to change to public IP addresses in order to access internet because you cant use Private IP...
... addresses to access internet. 
APIPA (169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254) - network card not getting a response from DHCP server
Subnet (subfamily) - purpose to sub the network aka breaking it down into pieces
