**1st Layer of the OSI Model = Physical Layer**
[Physical- Bits- 1's & o's ]
 -Wired: T/P (twisted pair ((8 wires))= 4TP, 5TP : STP($$$), UTP, TIA/EIA (govt, and business : have "Categories" such as.. 
... CAT3(4 wires), CAT5e(8wires), Cat6a, Cat7e, Cat8a // Coax (copper)= 50 ~, 75 ~, RG-6, F-type- BNC, Better than T/P, ..
... More expensive, Difficult to work with // Fiber (light) = Glass, Plastic, Light = SINGLE MODE (ADDTL.: long distance, small core,...
... minimal reflection and attenuation, one light at a time, more expensive) MULTIMODE (short distance, bigger core, more disperssion..
... and attenuation, multiple light modes to pass through, cheaper) 
*RJ45 = 8 [ |||||||| ] - used for Ethernet  // RJ11 = 4 [ |||| ] - used for telephone system
 -Wireless: Antenna - 
 Plenum = ceiling cableing = more expensive 
 Riser Space = btw 2 floors = used in ver4tical spaces (aka btw floors), prevent spread of fire btw floors, more cost effective
 Connectors (for Fiber) : ST (wist cable), SC (one click cable), LC (two click combined cable)
 ** TX vs RS** Transmit / Receive (ex. RX TO TX & TX to RX = one end ((Tx)) connecting to the other end ((Rx))
 Demarc = (marc bonding btw telco vs private) 
 MDF= (main distribution frame) 
 IDF = (intermediate distribution frame)
 Telco = (telecome service provider) 
 Baseband = digital (block like signal) 
 Broadband - analog (wave like signal) 
 DUPLEX: -Half Duplex = "walkie - talkie" m- need a token to speak - cannot speak at the same time 
... - Full Duplex = "talk at the same time" - many frequencies 
TRANSRECEIVERS: (& Receivers) convert Digital Data into Digital Signal (encoding/decoding)
**to convert digital signal to analog > use a modem**
**repeater can be used for analog and digital signal**
**amplifrier - used for analog = to analog**
ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM: 
 -Bandwidth = thereotical 
 -Throughoutput =
 -Attenuation = loss of signal strenght as it travels from source.
